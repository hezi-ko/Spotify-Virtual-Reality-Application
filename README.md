# Spotify-Virtual-Reality-Application
I prototyped in Unity with custom C# scripts and colliders to implement “play,” “add/remove,” and “open/close playlist” mechanics. I planned and ran three rounds of user testing (paper/physical, AR, then VR), and iterated feedback cues, object behaviour, and layout. I documented trade-offs that led to the final desk-friendly interaction model.
